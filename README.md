# DroidDrop
The speed and ease of use of AirDrop on Android!
## What DroidDrop can do
Currently DroidDrop searches for other users who have the app opened and lets the user select who they'd like to connect to. Once connected, the UI changes color to let the user know the connection has been made and files can be sent back and forth.
